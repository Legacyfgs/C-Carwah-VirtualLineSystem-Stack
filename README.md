# C-Carwash-VirtualLineSystem-Stack

This program displays a menu with the following items.

                                    ******** Welcome to Virtual line system ************
1. Call a customer 
2. Add a customer 
3. Quit

 When option 1 is selected, if there is no customer in the line, give some warning such as there is no customer for now. Otherwise, print the name of the first customer in the line and remove it from the line.
 When option 2 is selected, ask for the name of the customer and add the customer to the end of the line.
 When option 3 is selected, the program exits/terminate.


                                               ************* Stack *************
                                               
Assume that you are working at a restaurant and your job is to put plates in a cabinet. The way you put the plates is one on top of another until the cabinet is full. When you want to use the plates you take the plate that is on top in the cabinet until they are all finished.
I've Implemented a class called Stack using a Link data structure that solves the problem above. The stack should have the following methods:
 push(item)
 pop()
 peek()
 isEmpty() 
 size()

                                              ************* Car Wash *************
                                              
There is a local car wash that gives service at a low price. As a result, a lot of people want to have their cars washed there. The cars queue in line based on their arrival time. The car that arrives first is washed first. Remember you can only park your car in the queue if it is not full.
 a class called Queue that implements and simulates the above scenario using a queue data structure. The class should have the following methods:
 
 enqueue(item)
 dequeue()
 isEmpty()
 size()
